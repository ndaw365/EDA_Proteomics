# UpSet_Plots

This repository contains an .RMD file which is able to generate UpSet plots where the top 90% & top 95% are compared across cell lines to see similarities in expression.

The input for this code includes the protein_quant_current_normalized.csv file, which is manipulated to generate UpSet plots.
